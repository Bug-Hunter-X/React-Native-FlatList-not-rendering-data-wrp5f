# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data correctly.  The problem is likely due to an asynchronous update of the component's state.  The solution involves ensuring that the state is updated after the component has mounted and the data is ready.

## Problem

The initial implementation of the FlatList uses useEffect to set the data for the list. However, even though the DATA array is populated, the FlatList component remains empty.  This is a classic example of how asynchronous operations can lead to unexpected behavior in React Native.
